<h2>How to do a straightforward web scrapping on Python ?</h2>

<p>This old project comes from back when I was a Master 1 student in econometrics. 
  Our teacher gave us an excel file full of Pok√©mons and asked us to derive some dataviz out of it (using the usual suspects, 
  seaborn, pyplot and so on). I decided to go beyond the work I was entitled to and decided to add further information
  in the dataset such as height, weight, catch rate and hatch steps.</p>

<p>Please click on Chimchar to have a look at the code !</p>
