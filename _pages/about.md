<h1>**GaÃ«tan LE FLOCH**</h1>
<h2>Research engineer at Nantes University</h2>

Welcome to my profile ! I am an economist with a keen interest in economic research, currently involved into a M.Phil. at Paris-Dauphine University where I chose a specialisation in macroeconomics and finance.

My experiences lie in the fields of econometrics, statistics and financial regulation. I am currently a research engineer dwelling on commodity prices and regulation at LEMNA (Nantes University). In order to run my researches, I use several programming languages, among them R, Python and Matlab.
